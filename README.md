# ShotgunJump: a game for [Pashtet Jam #4](https://itch.io/jam/pashtet-jam-4) built as an experiment using Raylib + Odin on web.

The raylib-wasm-odin project is based on [Cadeo](https://github.com/Caedo/raylib_wasm_odin)'s repo.

## Build (tested only on Linux)

Just run `build.sh` to build the game, place the `index.html` into the `build` directory and then run any web-server to serve that directory. You need to have Emscripten installed in your system.
